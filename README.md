This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run application:

Navigate to folder 'Ninjas' then run:

- npm install
- npm start

If application not open, you'll find it at localhost:3000

### Dependencies

- styled-components

## Thoughts

I think the UX/UI part is the most fun to work with! But since the assignment was limited to 3-6h and not supposted to be 'over-engineered', this is what I come up with in this small amount of time.

I used 'npx create-react app' just to set the fundation of the project. I could have used just the CDN for this small task, but desided to go for this instead.

I know that the assignment were supposed to have at least 2 points from each section. I'm not used to write tests on my own but I have written a bunch of unit tests according to a reference schedule. So, I want to learn more about testning. So I went for creating a more user friendly page.

The points I selected to implement I have finnished and is currently working.

For the Git part, I'm usually working with feature branches and not in the master branch directly. Working with one branch at a time.
